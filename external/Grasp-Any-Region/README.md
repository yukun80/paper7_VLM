**TL; DR**: Our Grasp Any Region (GAR) supports both (1) describing a *single* region of an image or a video in the form of points/boxes/scribbles/masks in detail and (2) understanding *multiple* regions such as modeling interactions and performing complex reasoning. We also release a new benchmark, GARBench, to evaluate models on advanced region-level understanding tasks.

🔥🔥🔥 GAR has been accepted by **ICLR 2026**!

> **Abstract.** While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle
> in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate
> details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
> previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting
> crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehensive 
> region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay
> technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
> modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced
> compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the
> paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GARBench, which
> not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
> importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive
> experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning
> capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling rela-
> tionships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing
> InternVL3-78B on GARBench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
> in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily
> transferred to videos.

# Installation

```bash
conda create -n gar python=3.11.2 -y
conda activate gar

pip3 install xtuner==0.2.0rc0
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1 --no-build-isolation -v
```

# Demos

## Gradio Demo

Please refer to [`demo/gradio/README.md`](demo/gradio/README.md) for serving an online captioning demo using gradio.

## Examples

### Detailed Localized Image Descriptions with Masks

- [`demo/gar_with_mask.py`](demo/gar_with_mask.py) - Command-line tool for processing single images, allowing users to specify specify the region-of-interest using its segmentation mask.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see example commands</summary>

<img src="assets/1_output_visualization.png" width="400">

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node=1 --master-port=8119 demo/gar_with_mask.py --image_path assets/demo_image_1.png --mask_path assets/demo_mask_1.png
```

**Input instruction:** Describe the masked region in detail.

**Output answer:** A bright green, **frog-shaped slipper** with a smooth, rounded body and a wide, open mouth. The slipper has a small, raised bump on the top of its head, resembling a frog's eye.

### Detailed Localized Image Descriptions with SAM

- [`demo/gar_with_sam.py`](demo/gar_with_sam.py) - Command-line tool for processing single images using SAM v1, allowing users to specify points or bounding boxes for mask generation

<details>
<summary>Expand to see example commands</summary>

<img src="assets/2_output_visualization.png" width="400">

```bash
# You can use it with points or a bounding box for the region of interest.
# SAM is used to turn points or a bounding box into a mask.
# You can also use mask directly, see `demo/gar_with_mask.py`.
torchrun --nproc-per-node=1 --master-port=8119 demo/gar_with_sam.py --image_path assets/demo_image_2.jpg --points '[[1172, 812], [1572, 800]]' --output_image_path output_visualization.png
torchrun --nproc-per-node=1 --master-port=8119 demo/gar_with_sam.py --image_path assets/demo_image_2.jpg --box '[800, 500, 1800, 1000]' --use_box --output_image_path output_visualization.png
```

**Input instruction:** Describe the masked region in detail.

**Output answer:** A medium-sized, short-haired dog with a predominantly tan coat featuring white markings on its face, chest, and paws. The dog has a white stripe running down the center of its face, extending from the forehead to the nose. Its ears are large, pointed, and stand erect. The dog is wearing a red collar with a visible tag. Its mouth is open, revealing its tongue and teeth, and it appears to be in mid-leap with its front legs extended forward and hind legs stretched out behind.

### Modeling Complex Relationship between Multiple Regions

- [`demo/gar_relationship.py`](demo/gar_relationship.py) - Command-line tool for processing single images with multiple regions-of-interest, allowing users to specify specify the region-of-interest using its segmentation mask

<details>
<summary>Expand to see example commands</summary>

<img src="assets/3_output_visualization.png" width="400">

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node=1 --master-port=8119 demo/gar_relationship.py --image_path assets/demo_image_3.png --mask_paths "['assets/demo_mask_3_0.png', 'assets/demo_mask_3_1.png', 'assets/demo_mask_3_2.png']" --question_str 'Question: What is the relationship between <Prompt0>, <Prompt1>, and <Prompt2>?\nOptions:\nA. <Prompt0> is using <Prompt2> to point at <Prompt1>\nB. <Prompt0> has already hit <Prompt1> with <Prompt2>\nC. <Prompt0> is swinging <Prompt2> and is about to hit <Prompt1>\nD. <Prompt0> is holding <Prompt2> while looking away from <Prompt1>'
```

**Input instruction:**

```
Question: What is the relationship between <Prompt0>, <Prompt1>, and <Prompt2>?
Options:
A. <Prompt0> is using <Prompt2> to point at <Prompt1>
B. <Prompt0> has already hit <Prompt1> with <Prompt2>
C. <Prompt0> is swinging <Prompt2> and is about to hit <Prompt1>
D. <Prompt0> is holding <Prompt2> while looking away from <Prompt1>
Answer with the correct option's letter directly.
```

**Output answer:** C

Note that `<Prompt0>`, `<Prompt1>`, and `<Prompt2>` are illustrated in <span style="color:#C00000;">red</span>, <span style="color:#00B050;">green</span>, and <span style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span>, respectively.

# Training

**1. Dataset Preparation**

First, download the dataset:

`hf download HaochenWang/Grasp-Any-Region-Dataset --local-dir data --repo-type dataset`

The overall data structure should be:
```sh
data
├── Fine-Grained-Dataset
│   └── data-*-of-*.arrow
├── Relation-Dataset
│   └── data-*-of-*.arrow
└── Seed-Dataset
    └── data-*-of-*.arrow
```

**2. Launch Training**

Next, run the following script to train using 8 GPUS:

`bash tools/dist.sh train projects/grasp_any_region/configs/gar_1b.py 8`

**3. Convert to HuggingFace Format**

```python3 projects/grasp_any_region/hf_models/convert_to_hf.py projects/grasp_any_region/configs/gar_1b.py --pth-model PATH_TO_PTH_MODEL --save-path PATH_TO_SAVE_FOLDER```

Note that this script only convert the checkpoint and some `*.py` files requires manually copy to `${PATH_TO_SAVE_FOLDER}`.
